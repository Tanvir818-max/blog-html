            <h5>Intro...</h5>
            My day trip in the mountains almost took a turn for the worst. Our trip was nothing but normal. To start with, we had planned this trip for weeks, as we don’t get to take these rides as often as we used to. There was nothing unusual about this trip, we had taken the exact one three times before, it was supposed to be a short day trip up to a modest town called Crown King. If all went well, we would take our brand new UTV, and go offroading through the twisty mountain turns. Hopefully, we would arrive in town around noon, eat lunch at the only restaurant in the entire town, and spend the rest of our day travelling back to make it home before dinner.

            <p class="intro">
              This turned out to not be the case. My personal life lesson is to always expect the best, but be prepared for the worst. To begin with, our journey begins with taking a nice day trip through the mountainside. Our trip starts out as any other, we wake up as early as humanly possible, throw as many things together as quickly as we can to get out the door, and meet our friends we will be riding with at the gas station in town. Then we take the two hour drive to get to the rest area where we can unload our things and begin off-roading. One thing we never consider with our trips is that we always end up in some …show more content…

We arrived in town around eleven and quickly realized that everywhere had shut down, so we called around to little cabins and inns to see if any would be open for us to sleep for the night. After many attempts at finding a place to stay, we finally received an answer and we found a small little cabin for us all to stay in. The cabin was supposed to only house four people, but we managed to somehow fit all nine of us. The cabin lady was nice enough to give us what little food she had as she realized that we had just gotten into town. I ate my can of cold chili and dozed off for the night. Thus, everyone learned a valuable lesson that night, never show up

            <h5>Places to visit</h5>
            <p class="intro">After riding the trails for about half an hour, we stop in a big meadow where we can ride around and race. My favorite thing to do in times like this is to go exploring. So I start driving a little ways away from the group with Aftyn right behind me. Then, we find it. A big open untouched meadow. And off we go. Our engines roaring as we take off. Aftyn and I love to race. I went to the left and was riding in a big open area while Aftyn went over to the right and was side hilling. I was just coming over a hill when the unthinkable happened. …show more content…

              All I could see was black. What just happened? Where am I? Am I hurt? When I was able to think straight I realized where I was. My left arm and head were completely buried in the snow. The rest of my body was curled up in front of my sled. I tried to move my arm, but I couldn’t. It was stuck under the ski. So there I was, stuck under my snowmobile; nowhere to go. Since Aftyn was right behind me, she saw the whole thing. She came running up and started to unbury my head. I was yelling, “Back up the sled!” But she didn’t hear me. When my head was unburied enough that I could breath, she went to go find our
